        <p><STRONG>Electronic                     Records.</STRONG> To facilitate electronic commerce, to reduce                     the expense of records storage, and to obtain the benefits                     of faster access to records, you acknowledge and agree that                     we may in our discretion store all records electronically;                     and that we will not retain and have no obligation to retain                     any original documents for any period of time. This applies                     to all documentation including but not limited to checks,                     transaction records, notes, mortgages, deeds of trust and                     other loan and/or security documentation. You further acknowledge                     and understand that we will routinely destroy all original                     documentation. We may store records electronically via imaging,                     scanning, filming or other technology used in the financial                     services industry for the storage of documentation via internal                     processes or third-party processors that we approve for these                     services. You agree that such storage shall be secure, and                     further agree that such records shall for all purposes be                     recognized and admissible in evidence or otherwise to prove                     the agreements, rights and obligations of the parties pursuant                     to any such records. </p>
        <p><STRONG>&ldquo;E-Mail&rdquo;                      and Facsimile Communications.</STRONG> You acknowledge and                     agree that the Internet is considered inherently insecure.                     Therefore, you agree that we have no liability to you whatsoever                     for any loss, claim or damages arising or in any way related                     to our response(s) to any e-mail or other electronic communication,                     which we in good faith believe you have submitted to us. We                     have no duty to investigate the validity or to verify any                     e-mail or other electronic communication; and may respond                     to an e-mail at either the address provided with the communication,                     the e-mail address in your Membership Application and Signature                     Card, or any other application or written communication actually                     received by us. Any account owner, co-borrower, or authorized                     user may change the e-mail address for statements or other                     information from us at any time.</p>
        <p>Although                     having no obligation to do so, we reserve the right to require                     authentication of e-mails or electronic communications. The                     decision to require authentication is in the sole discretion                     of the Credit Union. We will have no obligation, liability                     or responsibility to you or any other person or company if                     we do not act upon or follow any instruction to us if a communication                     cannot be authenticated to our satisfaction. Further, the                     Credit Union may not immediately receive e-mail communications                     that you send. Also, we will not take action based on e-mail                     requests until we actually receive your message and have a                     reasonable opportunity to act. We reserve the right to require                     any notices from you be submitted to us in writing, and we                     may refuse to send certain information through unsecured e-mail                     communications. If you need to contact the Credit Union immediately                     regarding an unauthorized transaction, stop payment request,                     or otherwise, you may call the Credit Union at 229-247-9930.</p>
